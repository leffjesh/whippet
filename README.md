implementation of the WHIPPET invasive plant eradication prioritization tool devleoped by Gina Darin and background information is available at:

- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20832930
- http://whippet.cal-ipc.org/pages/view/guide

You must read these resources to understand this tool. Implemented as a ESRI Python Toolbox for use in ESRI workflows by Jeff Lesh.

##Requirements

You must have ArcGIS installed in order to use this. Developed with ArcGIS 10.2.2 install, but probably works on older versions. If you are using a raster for you site value layer, then you must have the Spatial Analyst toolbox available for checkout.

##Setup/Installation

1. Download this repository using the "Download Zip" link on the right
2. In ArcGIS right-click in ArcToolbox window and select "Add Toolbox". Then navigate to the unzipped folder that you just downloaded.  The toolbox should now appear in your ArcToolbox window.

##Usage

### Species Scoring

You will first need to setup your species scores using the WHIPPET Species Assessment Form (WHIPPET Species Assessment Form.pdf) and placing the values into the species_scores.csv file that is included in this repository. Values currently provided in species_scores.csv are either from CAL-IPC (most) or Clackamas SWCD (some). 

To calculate scores, use the Cal-IPC Criteria (available online: http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Criteria.pdf) to score the WHIPPET criteria for:
-	Impact to Wildlands
  - Rate of Spread
  - Reproductive Ability

Assign a score using explanations in the scoring document for the remaining species-level criteria:
- Detectability (although youâ€™re welcome to score this at the population level, if you can get the data), 
- Control Effectiveness
- Control Cost.

###Distance and Area Scoring

Distances and area criteria "breaks" are used in calculating Conspecific score, Vector (mines, streams, streets) score, and Population Sizes scores.  The below options include defaults specified in WHIPPET manuals and others created somewhat abitrarily.  Consider changing for your own purpose by modifying the .pyt file and adding your own options.

####Conspecific Breaks

Used to score the distance of the population to other populations of the same species.  Used in assessing invasiveness.

| Option Name | Unit | Score | Min Unit Measurement | Max Unit Measurement |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| conspecifics option 1 (miles) | Mile | 10 | 0 | 0.1 |
|   |  | 6 | 0.1 | 1 |
|   |  | 3 | 1 | 10 |
|   |  | 1 | 10 | 25 |
|   |  | 0 | 25 | ~ |
| conspecifics option 2 (miles) | Mile | 10 | 0 | 0.05 |
|   |  | 6 | 0.05 | 0.5 |
|   |  | 3 | 0.5 | 5 |
|   |  | 1 | 5 | 12.5 |
|   |  | 0 | 12.5 | ~ |
| conspecifics option 3 (miles) | Mile | 10 | 0 | 0.01 |
|   |  | 6 | 0.01 | 0.05 |
|   |  | 3 | 0.05 | 0.1 |
|   |  | 1 | 0.1 | 1 |
|   |  | 0 | 1 | ~ |
| conspecifics option 4 (miles) | Mile | 10 | 0 | 0.001 |
|   |  | 6 | 0.001 | 0.01 |
|   |  | 3 | 0.01 | 0.1 |
|   |  | 1 | 0.1 | 1 |
|   |  | 0 | 1 | ~ |

####Population Breaks

Used to score the size of the population.

| Option Name | Unit | Score | Min Unit Measurement | Max Unit Measurement |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| area option 1 (acres) | Acre | 10 | 0 | 0.1 |
|   |  | 6 | 0.1 | 1 |
|   |  | 3 | 1 | 10 |
|   |  | 1 | 10 | 100 |
|   |  | 0 | 100 | ~ |
| area option 2 (acres) | Acre | 10 | 0 | 0.05 |
|   |  | 6 | 0.05 | 0.5 |
|   |  | 3 | 0.5 | 5 |
|   |  | 1 | 5 | 50 |
|   |  | 0 | 50 | ~ |
| area option 3 (acres) | Acre | 10 | 0 | 0.1 |
|   |  | 6 | 0.1 | 0.5 |
|   |  | 3 | 0.5 | 1 |
|   |  | 1 | 1 | 10 |
|   |  | 0 | 10 | ~ |


####Vector Breaks

Used to score the distance of a patch to a vector.

| Option Name | Unit | Score | Min Unit Measurement | Max Unit Measurement |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| distance option 1 (miles) | Mile | 10 | 0 | 0.1 |
|   |  | 6 | 0.1 | 1 |
|   |  | 3 | 1 | 10 |
|   |  | 1 | 10 | 25 |
|   |  | 0 | 25 | ~ |
| distance option 2 (miles) | Mile | 10 | 0 | 0.05 |
|   |  | 6 | 0.05 | 0.5 |
|   |  | 3 | 0.5 | 5 |
|   |  | 1 | 5 | 12.5 |
|   |  | 0 | 12.5 | ~ |
| distance option 3 (miles) | Mile | 10 | 0 | 0.01 |
|   |  | 6 | 0.01 | 0.1 |
|   |  | 3 | 0.1 | 1 |
|   |  | 1 | 1 | 5 |
|   |  | 0 | 5 | ~ |
| distance option 4 (miles) | Mile | 10 | 0 | 0.01 |
|   |  | 6 | 0.01 | 0.05 |
|   |  | 3 | 0.05 | 0.1 |
|   |  | 1 | 0.1 | 1 |
|   |  | 0 | 1 | ~ |


###Other usage details

- Patch size should be *gross patch size* supported units are sq. feet.
- All attribute scores should be normalized to 10, with one exception.  When using a raster layer normalize to 1000 (it will be automatically adjusted appropriately).
- If you don't have Accessibility data and/or Patch Size attributes for your invasive species dataset, you may still run this tool with the following modifications.  Create attributes of field type Long, Short, Double, or Float for these criteria and leave the value for each observation set to "Null".  Open the whippet_toolbox.pyt script in a text editor and modify the following values: 
```
default_population_score = 10
default_accessibility_score = 3
```

##Caveats

- This was tested using only sq. feet patch size data.
